# MCP Private Wiki Authentication POC - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Proof of Concept (POC) for the "Support for authentication with private wikis" feature in the MCP Internal Wiki project.

## Feature Description

The feature demonstrates:
1. The ability of the MCP server to connect to private wikis requiring authentication
2. Support for various authentication methods (Basic, Token, Custom headers, OAuth)
3. How to configure the MCP server to use authentication with specific wiki URLs
4. A complete working example with Docker for easy testing

## Implementation Details

The POC consists of the following components:

### 1. MCP Server
- Uses the existing MCP codebase
- Enhanced with authentication configuration in `mcp.config.json`
- Containerized with Docker for easy deployment

### 2. Private Wiki Server
- A simple Express.js server that serves markdown files
- Protected with Basic Authentication
- Contains fictive AWS server documentation (100 markdown files)
- Containerized with Docker

### 3. Docker Compose Configuration
- Orchestrates both containers
- Sets up networking between the services
- Provides optional VS Code server integration

### 4. Testing Tools
- Basic authentication tests
- Interactive test client
- Comprehensive documentation

## Authentication Methods

The POC demonstrates the following authentication methods:

1. **Basic Authentication** (Implemented)
   - Using username and password
   - Configured via `mcp.config.json`

2. **Token Authentication** (Configured but not demonstrated)
   - Bearer token support
   - Can be easily enabled by changing the auth type in `mcp.config.json`

3. **Custom Header Authentication** (Configured but not demonstrated)
   - Custom header name and value
   - Can be enabled by changing the auth type in `mcp.config.json`

4. **OAuth Authentication** (Configured but not fully implemented)
   - Support for OAuth 2.0
   - Requires additional development for token refresh

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Configuration

The authentication configuration in the MCP server is defined in `mcp.config.json`:

```json
{
  "auth": [
    {
      "urlPattern": "^http://markdown-server:3001",
      "type": "basic",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "secret"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `urlPattern` field uses a regular expression to match URLs that require this authentication method.

### Authentication Flow

1. The MCP server receives a request for wiki content
2. It checks the requested URL against the `urlPattern` in the auth config
3. If a match is found, it applies the corresponding authentication method
4. It makes a request to the wiki server with the authentication credentials
5. The wiki server authenticates the request and returns the content
6. The MCP server processes and returns the content to the client

## How to Run the POC

1. Navigate to the POC directory:
   ```bash
   cd poc-private-wiki
   ```

2. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

3. Test the authentication:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

4. Use the interactive test client:
   ```bash
   npm run interactive
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Authentication Methods**
   - Complete OAuth 2.0 implementation with token refresh
   - Support for client certificates
   - JWT authentication

2. **Security Improvements**
   - Secure credential storage
   - Environment variable support for sensitive data
   - Secret management integration

3. **Additional Wiki Types**
   - SharePoint integration with authentication
   - Confluence Cloud API support
   - GitHub Enterprise wikis

## Conclusion

This POC successfully demonstrates the MCP server's ability to authenticate with private wiki sources. It provides a solid foundation for implementing authentication support in the main codebase.
