# POC Completion Report

## Summary

The Proof of Concept (POC) for "Support for authentication with private wikis" has been successfully implemented and tested. This POC demonstrates the ability of the MCP server to authenticate with private wiki sources and retrieve content securely.

## What's Been Implemented

1. **Markdown Server with Authentication**
   - A simple Express.js-based Markdown server
   - Basic Authentication protection
   - 100 fictive AWS server documentation entries
   - CORS support
   - Health check endpoint

2. **MCP Server with Authentication Support**
   - Simplified MCP server implementation
   - Support for Basic Authentication
   - Connection to the private Markdown server
   - Health check endpoint

3. **Docker Configuration**
   - Docker Compose setup for both services
   - Network configuration for inter-container communication
   - Health check configuration

4. **Testing Tools**
   - Automated tests for authentication verification
   - Interactive client for easy testing
   - Utility scripts for service management

## How to Test the POC

The POC can be tested using the following commands:

```bash
# Start everything
./restart.sh

# Run automated tests
npm test

# Start interactive client
npm run interactive
```

## Issues Fixed

During the implementation, we encountered and fixed several issues:

1. Container health check configuration
2. Network connectivity between containers
3. JavaScript syntax error in server file
4. Issues with file paths in Dockerfiles
5. Authentication configuration and testing

## Next Steps

To integrate this POC into the main MCP project:

1. Update the main `wikiSource.ts` file with the authentication logic from this POC
2. Expand the authentication types (OAuth implementation)
3. Add support for secure credential storage
4. Add configuration UI for authentication settings in VS Code extension
5. Add comprehensive error handling for authentication failures

## Conclusion

This POC successfully demonstrates the feasibility of integrating private wiki authentication into the MCP server. The implementation shows that the MCP server can securely connect to authenticated wiki sources and provide their content to clients without exposing credentials.
