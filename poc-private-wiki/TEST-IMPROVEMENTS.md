# POC Authentication Test Improvements

This document explains the improvements made to the test scripts for the MCP Private Wiki Authentication POC.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Retry Logic

The test scripts now include a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff for all HTTP requests:

```javascript
async function axiosWithRetry(config, maxRetries = 3, delay = 1000) {
  let retries = 0;
  while (retries < maxRetries) {
    try {
      return await axios(config);
    } catch (error) {
      // Don't retry on 401 (unauthorized) - that's expected in some tests
      if (error.response && error.response.status === 401) {
        throw error;
      }
      
      retries++;
      if (retries >= maxRetries) {
        throw error;
      }
      
      console.log(`âš  Request failed, retrying (${retries}/${maxRetries}): ${error.message}`);
      // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay * Math.pow(2, retries - 1)));
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Service Readiness Detection

Instead of using a fixed wait time, the tests now actively check if the services are ready:

```javascript
async function checkServiceReadiness(url, maxRetries = 5, delay = 2000) {
  // Dynamically check if service is ready
  // Returns true if service is ready, false otherwise
}
```

### 3. Better Error Handling

Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages:

- Connection errors are reported with suggestions for troubleshooting
- Server errors include response status codes and data
- Authentication errors are properly detected and reported

### 4. Comprehensive Test Results

The test script now provides a clear summary of test results:

```
=== POC Test Results ===
Markdown server authentication: âœ“
Markdown server with credentials: âœ“
MCP server wiki access: âœ“
âœ… All tests passed successfully! The POC is working correctly.
ðŸ”’ Private wiki authentication is working properly.
```

### 5. Health Check Before Tests

A health check is performed on each service before running tests to ensure they are available:

```javascript
// Check if MCP server is available first
console.log(`Checking if MCP server is available...`);
```

## Using the Improved Tests

No changes are needed to run the tests. Use the existing npm scripts:

```bash
# Run the automated tests
npm run test

# Run the interactive test client
npm run interactive
```

## Benefits

These improvements make the tests:

1. More reliable - Tests will work even if services take longer to start
2. More informative - Clear error messages and test summaries
3. More robust - Retries handle temporary network glitches
4. More maintainable - Better code structure and error handling
