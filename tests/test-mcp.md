# MCP Wiki Test

This is a test file to verify that the MCP Wiki server is working correctly.

Try typing a query that might be found in your configured wikis, such as:
- "DevOps examples"
- "NixOS configuration"
- "Wiki documentation"

If the MCP server is configured correctly, you should see relevant suggestions from the wiki sources.
